# Uber-Data-Analysis
This repo analyzes Uber ride data to reveal patterns in trip frequency, geographic spread, duration, fares, and user behavior using a dataset (e.g., NYC TLC/Kaggle). With Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly), it includes data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations of peak times, routes, and seasonality.
